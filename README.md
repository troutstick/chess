why use an optimized and functional library when you can not???

in short: here i mess around and try to program a game of chess which can be played from command line

maybe i'll even add a gui someday

* bitboards????? pfffffffffffffft

* late move reduction? centipawns? mating nets? haha we don't do that stuff here amigo

* wavedashing? f-tilt? get outta here
  
anyways, this is basically the next stockfish
